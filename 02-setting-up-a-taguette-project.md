Once we have a general sense of the data we'll be using and what format it needs to be in, the next step is generally to create a project in a qualitative software package and import the de-identified raw data.

::: callout

Qualitative software is sometimes called **CAQDAS**, an acronym for *Coding and Qualitative Data Analysis Software* to recognize the two essential functions of qualitative research software:

1. Apply codes or tags systematically to a collection of data sources
2. Analyze codes (and sometimes raw data or secondary sources) to draw conclusions

CAQDAS have various features that may be useful for particular types of data or methodologies. This lesson includes an [alternative software options page](../learners/alternative-software-options.html) for those interested in learning about other CAQDAS.
