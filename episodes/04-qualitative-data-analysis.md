::: questions
-   How can Taguette help analyze coded data?
-   What are some common approaches to analyzing qualitative data?

::: objectives
-   Practice drawing conclusions about cases and themes with Taguette
-   Distinguish questions answerable using cases, themes, or only in combination
:::

By the end of coding, researchers can be quite familiar with the data.
Even if they have already drawn some tentative conclusions, structured
data analysis is important to validate findings, discover alternatives,
and document evidence and rationales. This step increases the research's
impact and value not just for others, but for future revision or
expansion of your own research.

How you can analyze your data depends on multiple decisions, including your software, the type of data you have, and how you structured your codes. But the choice of methods also depend on your research questions.

## Cases

In qualitative analysis, cases most often represent individual people, like those interviewed in the BSR interviews.

We have already done some informal case-based analysis.

HOW TO ANALYZE CASES

### Groups

A case is not always a person. It can also be a document, an organization, a news source, or another unit of aggregation whose members are categorically distinct from one another. This primarily occurs in content analysis, rather than interview and focus group research.

Brittany Shaughnessy, for example, wrote a [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10919/103776), studying gun rights messaging in the 2020 US election. She performed qualitative content analysis on Twitter posts from the official accounts of two advocacy organizations: Everytown for Gun Safety (pro gun control) and the National Rifle Association (pro gun rights). 

In this situation, individual media relations personnel are not the primary interest, even if we could identify them. The purpose of the research is to compare the topics and language used by advocacy organizations with contrasting goals.
