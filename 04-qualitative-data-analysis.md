By the end of multiple rounds of hand-coding interview transcripts or
other qualitative data, researchers can be quite familiar with the data.
Even if they have already drawn some tentative conclusions, structured
data analysis is important to validate findings, discover alternatives,
and document evidence and rationales. This step increases the research's
impact and value not just for others, but for future revision or
expansion of your own research.
