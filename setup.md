title: Setup
---

In this workshop, we will practice reusing qualitative data with the software
Taguette and a collection of interviews about data reuse published online.
Please follow the steps below before the workshop to set up your computer.

## Data Sets

The data we will use is available from the [Qualitative Data Repository][qdr] 
(QDR) and requires creating a free QDR account.
You are welcome to create an account before the workshops, but we will walk 
through the process of setting up an account and downloading the data during 
the workshop.

## Software Setup

We will use the free Coding and Qualitative Data Analysis software Taguette
throughout the workshop.
When possible, Taguette should be set up to run on your computer by following 
the latest [Windows, Mac, or Linux instructions][taguette_install].

When running Taguette, initially a command line window will open. 
This is a window, usually with a black background. 
As Taguette runs, lines of text will appear in the command line window. 
Then the Taguette interface will open in your default web browser. 
You do not need to interact with the command line window. 
Leave it open in the background, and work on projects in your web browser.

If you are unable to install Taguette on your own computer, 
a [free cloud version][taguette_cloud] is also available from the developers,
after creating a login.

We will demonstrate using a local version of Taguette, 
but the cloud interface looks and functions identically except for the addition
of an "Account" menu at the top right, the lack of offline functionality, 
and the ability to share collaborative projects with others without 
[self-hosting][taguette_server].
